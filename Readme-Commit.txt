Change the naming of the WMM files. 

This implies changes in FFMM export names and GUI

Changed the logics derived from the naming

In FFMM there is no need for the user to say whether the magnet is normal or skew

at each stage of fabrication iron/collared, inner/outer the magnet will always be at the same Normal/skew configuration.
